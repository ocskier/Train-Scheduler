# Train-Scheduler
Train Scheduling using Firebase

* [`index.html] (Train-Scheduler/index.html)

### Instructions

* This is an app for tracking a train database with real-time updating 

* The app allows the user to input a new train or update existing trains

* The user can add a train with name, destination, first train time and how often it runs
   
* The train will be written to a firebase database where all current trains are stored

* The app displays the current time and updates every minute

* A constantly playing gif from Giphy is displayed on the page for aesthetics

* Any train currently in the database can be either updated or cancelled 

* Currently the user has until the next minute to update

* Any train can be cancelled at anytime and the page will update in a second

* This app can also be found in my portfolio @ https://ocskier.github.io/My-Mat-Portfolio
